# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Amazon-Kindle-Book-Reviews

Hey, bookworms like me! Welcome to my little project where I'm on a mission to spill the tea on what people really think about those Amazon Kindle books! 📚🔍

## Data
I've got my hands on a treasure trove of Amazon Kindle book reviews. It's a mix of ratings and those little snippets of text where readers pour out their hearts

## Here's a quick rundown of what I've done:

Pre-processing: I've cleaned up the text and organized the data to prepare it for analysis.<br />
Visualization: I've created visually appealing word clouds to showcase the most popular words in the reviews. <br />
Model Building: I've used a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict sentiment based on the text. <br />
Sentiment Analysis: I've explored the polarity and subjectivity of the reviews to understand the overall sentiment expressed by readers. <br />
